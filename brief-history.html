                        <h2>The Story of EZPREZONE</h2>
                        <p>Our coffee journey began with a simple love for espresso the heart of every coffee. From that passion came the idea of creating a café where espresso isn’t just a drink, but the soul of every cup we serve.

The shop first opened its doors on September 13, 2024, right here in the center of Calabanga. The location was chosen not just for convenience, but because it offers the perfect balance: close to everything, yet peaceful enough to enjoy a cup of coffee without the rush. The second-floor setting, with an alfresco space and a cozy tambayan vibe, makes it a special place to unwind, study, or spend time with friends.

In just one year, our café grew from an idea to a beloved spot for locals. We introduced signature croffles  a unique croissant-waffle hybrid alongside espresso-based drinks, tiramisu, puddings, and other desserts that quickly became customer favorites. Word of mouth, a growing social media community, and our loyal customers turned the shop into a little hub for good coffee and good company.

Though the journey hasn’t been without challenges from managing competition to handling operations by hand  the shop continues to thrive because of the love for coffee and the support of the community. We keep our doors open not just to serve coffee, but to share moments, laughter, and stories with everyone who visits.

Here, coffee isn’t just a drink. It’s an experience.</p>
                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>

                        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
